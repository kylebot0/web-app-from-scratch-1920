## To Do and features üìå
Things to do in this project:

- [ ] Add own templating engine.


Features:

- [x] Add detail page.
- [x] Add own router.
- [x] Display multiple api calls.
- [x] Local storage implementation.

## Description üìù
This project uses the SpaceX API to display their rockets, missions, launches, capsules and ships. It has certain overview pages and detailpages. The detailpages feature all the extra content when you search for it. To get the different kind of overview pages, the app calls to a different api to get the data. Once the data has been received it goes in a local storage, so it can be used throughout the application. I also coded my own router and hashhandler in this app, so if you type a # in the url and the correct id following the item you're searching it gives you the detail page, or overview. If it isn't found, it directs you to a not found page.

## Actor diagram
The actor diagram features my most important actors in the app, this doesn't include helper function written in my different modules.

## Interaction diagram
The interaction diagram features the interaction in this app, this doesn't include helper function written in my different modules. Some important choices the app makes, are for example checking if the local storage is already in use. Or if it's a detail / overview page that's being asked by the client.

## Installing üîç
To install this application and enter the repo write the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/kylebot0/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git && cd web-app-from-scratch-1920
```

Because this project uses different modules, you'll have to npm install to get the different dependecies
```
npm install
```
To build all the modules, run
```
npm run watch
```

### Packages and Technologies
This project makes use of the following packages and technologies:

  * Webpack

## API üêí
The data used throughout the application is from the SpaceX API ```https://api.spacexdata.com/v3```.
It is a free public api with no rate limit, and can be called as many times as you want.

Because i call the API, from different links the data can vary.
The data has i.e. the following structure:
```javascript
{
    "mission_name": "Iridium NEXT",
    "mission_id": "F3364BF",
    "manufacturers": [
      "Orbital ATK"
    ],
    "payload_ids": [
      "Iridium NEXT 1",
      "Iridium NEXT 2",
      "Iridium NEXT 3",
      "Iridium NEXT 4",
      "Iridium NEXT 5",
      "Iridium NEXT 6",
      "Iridium NEXT 7"
    ],
  },
```

If you want to look at the docs from the API, and or are interested in easily seeing how it works. 
SpaceX uses postman for that.
