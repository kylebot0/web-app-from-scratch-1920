## Description 📝
This project uses the SpaceX API to display their rockets, missions, launches, capsules and ships. It has certain overview pages and detailpages. The detailpages feature all the extra content when you search for it. To get the different kind of overview pages, the app calls to a different api to get the data. Once the data has been received it goes in a local storage, so it can be used throughout the application. I also coded my own router and hashhandler in this app, so if you type a # in the url and the correct id following the item you're searching it gives you the detail page, or overview. If it isn't found, it directs you to a not found page.

## Actor diagram
The actor diagram features my most important actors in the app, this doesn't include helper function written in my different modules.

## Interaction diagram
The interaction diagram features the interaction in this app, this doesn't include helper function written in my different modules. Some important choices the app makes, are for example checking if the local storage is already in use. Or if it's a detail / overview page that's being asked by the client.
